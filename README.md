# üìÉ POSTalion

Lightweight & painless HTML5 form backend

> Ever wanted to simply list a few fields, set an email account and receive emails every time someone submits your HTML5 form?
> Me too, and that's what POSTalion is for! While there are lots of different services for that usecase, none I tested were able
> to work independently to be used e. g. with a static site, could receive file uploads and send them as attachments and were
> well-maintained & up-to-date ([FormTools üò¢](https://github.com/formtools/core)). That's why I created POSTalion.
